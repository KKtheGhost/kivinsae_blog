## <b>My Bio</b>

- I work as an Infrastructure engineer in a foreign company and I live in Shanghai.
- So far, I have spent my entire career in the gaming industry, but I hope to work in other computer-related fields in the future, if the opportunity arises. From my personal point of view, DevOps/Infra engineers are more like a versatile type of engineer. There is room to excel in fields that require digitization and high availability service construction.
- I am married and have two cats - a ragdoll and a British shorthair.
- I have a good command of English, with a score of 8.5 in the IELTS speaking test. My Japanese, on the other hand, is at a pure beginner level - I can understand it when reading or listening, but I struggle to speak it. Among my peers, I speak the best Wu dialect because I didn't learn Mandarin until I was 4 years old.
- I used to be interested in politics, but now I would ban such topics immediately. It's a dangerous game that can lead to real harm.
- I am an overly confident person, perhaps due to my ENTJ-A personality type. As a result, I don't have many friends - to put it another way, I've only made it this far by being thick-skinned.
- I am generally tight-lipped, but the root cause is actually forgetfulness.
- I primarily write Python, C, and Ruby in my daily work, with a recent focus on Powershell scripting and previous experience with Bash. I dabbled in Go for a while, but I haven't been using it recently. However, I could easily pick it up again.
- Containerization and Infrastructure as Code are great advances, but HCL and Yaml are not aesthetically pleasing. However, as a user, I can't think of any better alternatives.
- My favorite game series are *Monster Hunter* and *Puzzle & Dragons*. These are the only two game series that I have played continuously for more than 10 years.
